            <h2>Bouldering</h2>
            <p>Bouldering is one of the easiest ways to get started climbing.  Bouldering is climbing a short distance, above crash pads to protect your falls.  This means that the barrier to entry is very low - there isn't any gear requirements as long as you rent shoes.</p>

            <h2>Questions You May Have Getting Started:</h2>
            <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
            <p>Just bring or rent your shoes, and buy a day pass at a gym close by! Alternatively, if you are feeling adventurous, you can rent a crash pad or two, and find an outdoor climbing spot.  There are probably at least a few beautiful places that you can find nearby! You can find a boulder nearby using the Mtn Project app on your phone.</p>
            <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
            <p>For bouldering, all you need to bring is a pair of climbing shoes if you have them, but you can always rent if you don't have a pair.  The only other things you need for bouldering are chalk, if you prefer to have some, water and maybe a snack, in case you get hungry.</p>
