            <h2>Top Roping</h2>
            <p>Top roping is a type of climbing where a climber has a harness on and they are attached to the rope at the top of the wall.  At the top, there may be an autobelay, which is a machine that automatically controls the descent speed of a climber when they fall.  However, most of the time, the rope comes back down from the top, so that a second climber may control the speed.</p>
            <p>With all this information I'm giving you, I still recommend taking a course at a gym to get professional guidance on this skill, as it's something you have to be taught hands on with.</p>
            <h2>Questions You May Have Getting Started:</h2>
            <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
            <p>Like I stated above, I recommend taking a course.  The gym you take this at will most likely provide you with all the necessary gear for the session, and they will make sure everyone is safe while they learn.</p>
            <h3>What gear do I need?</h3>
            <p>For top rope climbing you will need to have or rent a pair of climbing shoes, a harness, and one person will need a carabiner and a belay device.</p>
